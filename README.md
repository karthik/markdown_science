# Markdown for scientific writing

[Markdown](http://inundata.org/2012/06/01/markdown-and-the-future-of-collaborative-manuscript-writing/) is a fantastic and minimalist tool for authoring scientific documents. This repository is a collection of tools, resources, and tutorials to simplfy your workflow. If you spend a little time going through the tutorials you'll be able to [stop using Microsoft Word entirely](http://inundata.org/2012/12/04/how-to-ditch-word/) and write clean, lightweight markdown files that can easily be version controlled by git. Collaboration with your coauthors would also become way more powerful and simpler.
